# osucaea: Osu <=> Arcaea conversion tool
Arcaea to/from osu! beatmap conversion tool

Since both Arcaea and osu! beatmap content is ASCII (human readable), I made this tool to convert these games' beatmap to each other.

### What is Arcaea
[Arcaea](https://arcaea.lowiro.com/en) is a rhythm-based game for Android/iOS by lowiro, this game have similar gameplay to osu!mania 4K with addition of Sky Input (Arcs and Sky Note)

### What is osu!
[osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh) is a click-based rhythm-game by peppy for Windows (and macOS/Linux with wine) which is initially based on osu! Tatakae! Ouendan
(Elite Beat Agents) by iNIS & Nintendo. This game have 4 modes: Circles (osu!), Taiko (osu!taiko), Fruits (osu!catch) and Mania (osu!mania).
This tool only support for 4 Key Mania (osu!mania 4K).

### Fun fact
- Arcaea beatmap file is ".aff" and not ".arc", those name is only an abbreviaton of the game name.
- I don't own any iOS device. if you own an jailbroken iOS and wanted to cover the modding steps, Welcome.
- osu! is single-tap and multi-key, while Arcaea is multi-tap.
